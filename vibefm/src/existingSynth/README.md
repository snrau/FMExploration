=================

![](images/yamaha-dx-7.png)

DX7 FM synthesis using the Web Audio and Web MIDI API. Works in Chrome and Firefox.
Use a MIDI or QWERTY keyboard to play the synth.

[Live demo of DX7 Synth JS](https://mmontag.github.io/dx7-synth-js/)

This is a high-level emulation of DX7 using FM synthesis principles. It's not super accurate, but good enough to produce most DX7 presets. Stereo panning has been added to the operators.

Controls: 

1. **QWERTY keys** to play notes
1. **Space bar** panic (all notes off)
1. **Control** hold down to increase QWERTY velocity
1. **Mouse wheel** over knobs and sliders to increase/decrease value
1. **Click or touch and drag up/down** on knobs and sliders to increase/decrease value
1. **Arrow up/down** on knobs and sliders to increase/decrease value
1. **Tab** moves between controls
